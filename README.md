# Assignment: Intro to Node
## Node Parking

This was a pair programming assignment. The objective was to use Node to load a data file, process it, and extract some information from it to present to the user. The data set was the parking violation data from February.

There are three modules present - data-processor.js loads and parses the csv file, analysis.js defines functions that get at the data we want, and app.js (the entry point) prints the results of the analysis to the console.

We made use of two node_modules - csv-parse and lodash.
